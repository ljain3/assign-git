•  What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
-> gitignore file is a simple text file which is kept in the project's root directory. It outlines which files should not be taken into account when committing a project to GitHub. [1]

•  What does fast-forward in git mean? 
-> Any merge where the main branch underwent changes between the branch point and the merge back to the main branch is referred to as a non-fast-forward merge. In this situation, rebasing instead of merging allows a user to imitate a fast-forward. Rebasing functions by  dropping some commits and adding new ones. [2]

•  Why should you have different branches? 
-> Branches help in securely trying out new ideas, developing functionalities, or addressing errors in a specific part of the repository. [3]

•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
-> One may own as many remotes as desired, but only one should be designated as the origin. [4]
